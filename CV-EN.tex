From website I learned about your need for a postdoctoral fellow in real-world autonomous vehicle behaviour and simulation of Cyber-physical Systems in Chalmers University of Technology. I am very interested in this project, and believe that my background on programming skills and experience in traffic simulation are appropriate for the position. 

I recently will graduate from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences with a Ph.D in Engineering Mechanics, from where I have studied the passive and active responses of cells under the stimulation of typical chemistry, multiple mechanics by theoretical analyses and numerical simulations. It provides the basis for understanding the mechanism of cell mechano-chemical coupling, and the dynamic response of cells to the specific chemical, mechanical stimulation. My thesis work not only involves mathematical modeling, but also requires a lot of programming.

In addition to my thesis work, I am very interested in mathematical models and computer simulations, especially in relation to traffic. I was so excited when I see vehicles that simulated is moving forward on my computer window. Although I have not received formal training in traffic simulation, the interest prompted me to learn a variety of traffic flow models, such as cellular automata and intelligent driver model. By writing MATLAB programs, I used these models to study several specific problems, such as \textbf{using Nagel-Schreckenberg cellular automata model to determine the optimal number of tollbooths to deploy in a barrier-toll plaza}, and \textbf{using Intelligent Driver Model to determine the optimal parking location in the 3D park}. 


Thank you very much for your time and kind consideration. Please contact me if you would like any further information. I look forward to hearing from you.
